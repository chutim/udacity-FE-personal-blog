# Personal Blog

This is the first exercise for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree course - a mock blog website using HTML & CSS concepts learned and/or reviewed in the first module, such as CSS Grid, Flexbox, and responsive layout. Only a homepage and a single blog post are required. Text was filled out randomly with a Lorem Ipsum generator.

The project is live at: https://chutim.github.io/udacity-FE-personal-blog/
